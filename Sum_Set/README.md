# Java-Sum_Set
Seeking subsets of a sum
<p>In this code, we will cope with a problem:</p>
<p>You have a given set of numbers, and give you a target. Seek all subsets from the given set so that sum of all elements in each subset equal to the target</p>
<b><i>For example: </b></i><br>
set = [1, 2, 3, 5]<br>
target = 5<br>
Subsets are: [5], [2, 3]<br>
<i>Important:</i> No duplicated subsets are accepted!
